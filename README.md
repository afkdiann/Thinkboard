This full-stack project was an introduction to the MERN stack for me. It contains functionalities similar to a "notes app" and supports core CRUD operations, such as adding, updating, and deleting notes. Although it was created following a tutorial on Youtube, I made slight changes to the styling and some of the components using my own knowledge on Tailwind CSS and React.
